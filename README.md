# plugins
Hello and welcome to this repository,
This repository contains all Minecraft plugins made by EPIC_PLAYER. 

# HelloPlugin
HelloPlugin represents my first ever created Minecraft plugin. 
Its function was unknown since it was the plugin I mainly used for testing needs. 
This plugin contains commands such as: heal, warp, spawn... Overrides for some default, built-in, commands, such as gamemode and a few event handlers that make this plugin even more interesting.

# ArenaPlugin
I can freely say that this is my first ever "official" plugin. 

You may be wondering, what's Arena? Let me explain you. Arena is a mode where a player is spawned in one big arena with one iron sword. Within a few seconds, mobs will start arriving from different sides and the goal is to get rid of them all. There are 4 waves that are seperated by a time period: Zombies, Spiders, Skeletons, and Creepers. After Skeletons arrive, the player will obtain a Diamond Sword which will surely help them fight the remanining mobs. The player can also earn coins by killing mobs. However, these coins don't really have any value.

I had a few plans with this plugin (adding a shop and waves), but I lost motivation for it. This plugin is full of bugs and is really hardcoded as well. It technically works but there are many bugs and exploits which can really ruin the experience of the person playing it.

If you were wondering "Could EPIC_PLAYER fix it?", then the answer is yes, however, as I said, I don't really have enough motivation for it and I am currently really busy with one other plugin, which is also the next plugin I will mention here!

# PracticePlugin
PracticePlugin, my biggest plugin so far.

What is the point of this plugin? Well, one day I asked myself: "Could I copy PikaNetwork Practice?", and I answered: "Yes, I can". Basically, the idea of making this plugin came when I was at the beginning of making HelloPlugin. On PikaNetwork Practice there is a feature where when a player types "ranked" in chat, it will open custom inventory containing all ranked practice modes. In HelloPlugin, after typing "ranked" in chat, a message saying "You executed ranked" would pop up in chat and that's pretty much it. Later I learned how to make custom inventories and then I created PracticePlugin.

PracticePlugin is not a 100% accurate copy of PikaNetwork Practice. Here are some differences: not all practice modes are included, ranks aren't included, a scoreboard is not included (for now), the chat format is not accurate, events, settings, parties, cosmetics, and leaderboards don't exist, and maps and the lobby aren't accurate. However, that's all fine since I started working on this plugin on August 14, 2021. For this whole day of making this plugin, I think I did a very good job. 
So far, the plugin has ranked and unranked inventory, standard lobby inventory, (not finished) nodebuff mode... Also, players can trigger ranked and unranked inventories by typing "unranked" and "ranked" in chat, the same as on PikaNetwork. All spawn features are the same like on PikaNetwork as well (blocks can't be broken or placed, tools in spawn are unbreakable, PvP is off, the hunger level is always maximum...). 

I don't know what else I can say about this plugin. It's pretty new so there is not so much stuff to talk about it.

That's it, you came to the end. Good job!
