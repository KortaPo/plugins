# plugins
Hello and welcome to this repository,
This repository contains all Minecraft plugins made by EPIC_PLAYER. 

# HelloPlugin
HelloPlugin represents my first ever created Minecraft plugin. 
Its function was unknown since it was the plugin I mainly used for testing needs. 
This plugin contains commands such as: heal, warp, spawn... Overrides for some default, built-in, commands, such as gamemode and a few event handlers which make this plugin even more interesting.

# ArenaPlugin
I can freely say that this is my first ever "official" plugin. 

You may be wondering, what's Arena? Let me explain you. Arena is a mode where player is spawned in one big arena with one iron sword. Within few seconds, mobs will start arriving from different sides and the goal is to get rid of them all. There are 4 waves which are seperated by time period: Zombies, Spiders, Skeletons and Creepers. After Skeletons arrive, player will obtain Diamond Sword which will surely help him fight the other remanining mobs. Player can also earn coins by killing mobs. However these coins don't really have any value.

I had few plans with this plugin (adding shop, adding waves), however I lost motivation for it. This plugin is full of bugs and is really hardcoded as well. It technically works but there are a lot of bugs and exploits which can really ruin player's experience playing it.

If you were wondering: "Could EPIC_PLAYER fix it?", then the answer is yes, however, as I said, I don't really have enough motivation for it and I am currently really busy with one other plugin, which is also the next plugin I will mention here!

# PracticePlugin
PracticePlugin, my biggest plugin so far.

What is the point of this plugin? Well one day I asked myself: "Could I copy PikaNetwork Practice", and I answered: "Yes I can". Basically idea of making this plugin came when I was at the beginning of making HelloPlugin. On PikaNetwork Practice there is a feature where when player types "ranked" in chat, it will open custom inventory containing all ranked practice modes. In HelloPlugin, after typing "ranked" in chat, a message saying "You executed ranked" would pop up in chat and that's pretty much it. Later I learned how to make custom inventories and then I created PracticePlugin.

PracticePlugin is not 100% accurate copy of PikaNetwork gamemode. Here are some differences: not all practice modes are included, ranks aren't included, scoreboard is not included (for now), chat format is not accurate, events, settings, parties, cosmetics and leaderboards don't exist and maps and lobby aren't accurate. But that's all ok since this plugin has been started working on on 14th August 2021. And for this whole day of making this plugin, I think I did very good job. 
So far, plugin has ranked and unranked inventory, standard lobby inventory, (not finished) nodebuff mode... Also, players can trigger ranked and unranked inventories by typing "unranked" and "ranked" in chat, same like on PikaNetwork. All spawn features are same like on PikaNetwork as well (blocks can't be broken or placed, tools in spawn are unbreakable, pvp is off, hunger level is always maximum...). 

I don't know what else could I say about this plugin, it's pretty new so there is not so much stuff to talk about it.

That's it, you came to an end, good job!
